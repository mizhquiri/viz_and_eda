I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

The code chunk below creates a data frame and generates a plot.

```{r plot example, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
#always load the tidyverse package for tibble!

plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500, mean = 2, sd = 4),
  y = 3 - 4.2 * x + rnorm(500)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

This plot is really great! it shows a linear equation as expected. 

The data frame has `r nrow(plot_df)` rows.
